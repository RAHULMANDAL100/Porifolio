                    <h2>climate change and water.</h2>
                    <p>Climate changes will, and already are, affecting every aspect of the hydrologic cycle. Actions
                        are needed to improve our understanding of water-related risks from climate change and to
                        explore and implement strategies to reduce these risks. The Pacific Institute works to quantify
                        climate changeâ€™s impacts on water systems and resources, cooperating with diverse stakeholders
                        to identify and develop solutions that promote more resilient water systems in the U.S. and
                        abroad. It is not too late to act to slow the rate of climate change and to reduce the ultimate
                        cost to public health, ecosystems, and the economy. We must reduce the severity of future
                        climate change through efforts to cut or mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from our water
                        systems, and we must adapt to climatic changes we can no longer avoid. The Pacific Institute has
                        published leading reports on climate change, energy, and water; elucidated the connections
                        between climate change, migration, and conflict; investigated the impacts of climate change on
                        agriculture, as well as adaptation strategies; evaluated the effects of climate change-induced
                        sea-level rise on the California coast; and more.</p>

                    <h2>World of Machine Learning.</h2>
                    <p>When beginning your educational path, it's important to first understand how to learn ML. We've
                        broken the learning process into four areas of knowledge, with each area providing a
                        foundational piece of the ML puzzle. To help you on your path, we've identified books, videos,
                        and online courses that will uplevel your abilities, and prepare you to use ML for your
                        projects. Start with our guided curriculums designed to increase your knowledge, or choose your
                        own path by exploring our resource library.</p>
